# Global-Bike-Inc.-Data-Cleaning
The Excel file contains two sheets, original data and clean data. A variety of formulas and procedures were applied on the original data to erase inconsistencies and ambiguity.


Used the DATE function to consolidate the date, month and year columns into a single column. 

Removed columns that provide no valuable insights such as Salesorg.
Kept numeric variables in only USD currency to erase confusion and make the data more readable.

Removed abbreviations for the values in the Country and Division column to make the data understandable. Used the REPLACE and IF function.

Converted the data in a table format.
