# Global-Bike-Inc.-Data-Cleaning

## Dataset Used
The Excel file contains two sheets, original data and clean data. A variety of formulas and procedures were applied on the original data to erase inconsistencies and ambiguity.

## Data Cleaning in Excel
* Used the DATE function to consolidate the date, month and year columns into a single column. 
* Removed columns that provide no valuable insights such as Salesorg.
* Kept numeric variables in only USD currency to erase confusion and make the data more readable.
* Removed abbreviations for the values in the Country and Division column to make the data understandable. Used the REPLACE and IF function.
* Converted the data in a table format.
